# FOOD4THOUGHT:"HouseofMentalEatery"
Techmecolor Community Project - 001

Purpose: House of Mental Eatery is a local startup that is in need of a website. The members of TechMeColor have taken on this local small business with the purpose providing an appropiate web presence for the startup. 

We are very excited as this project is our FIRST community project and the coding will be shared among the members of the group! Each person will work in a team so that members of this group can practice working on a team coding project.
